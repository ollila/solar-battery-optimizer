# solar-battery-optimizer
Python LP Optimizer for solar power plant and battery dimensioning utilizing PuLP solver. Currently program is very experimental stage and will most likely require at least basic undestanding of python to be usable.

Program will output cumulative cost and savings information in .png file. Program will also give hour-by-hour solar to battery, solar to immediate use, solar to grid, battery charging and discharging in optimized_decisions variable although it's not extracted to be visible.

**Inputs**

Currently codebase has been set to input information for two years (one year per file) from the following sources:
- Electricity price information from Entso-E in .csv format. Repository includes example files for 2022 and 2023
- Solar panel production from PVWatss in .csv format. Repository includes example file for 4 kWp plant in South Finland
- Solar panel production data from Fingrid Datahub has been commented out but can technically be used
- Houly consumption data from Fingrid Datahub. Converter from 15 min data to 60 min data is included as separate program. No example files included.

**Set up**

To set up program the following parameters should be considered defined for simulation:
- flex_load_percentage can be used to define flexible load which can be moved to cheapest hours. Default 0 will not include any load shifting
- battery_capacity_kWh is used to define size of battery in kWh. Defauls is 5 and 0 would simulate system with only solar panels
- max_charge_discharge_rate is used to define max discharge rate of battery in kW. Default is 2.5
- start_date is used to define first day of optimization calculation
- Last for loop in main program branch defines how many days are simulated. Default is 364

**FMI solar data**

Actual radiation data per location and calculated estimated production based of that.
